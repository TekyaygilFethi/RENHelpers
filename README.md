# REN (Regular Everyday Normal) Helper

Have you ever thought a world without repeating yourself? A world that you can focus only the important parts of the code instead of rewriting all the processes over and over again? A world that does not make you feel that you are trapped in the Matrix.

Well, I have. And I've created this library to help all of us with that. Ladies and gentlements, here is REN!
